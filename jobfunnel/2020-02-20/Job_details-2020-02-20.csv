The Who, What, Where and Why

You're a developer that enjoys empowering your peers. Some of your favorite projects during your career have likely been things like building MVPs, demo applications, or proofs of concepts. You get excited about starting the next project, incorporating what you've learned from the last ship.

We're looking for a Developer Educator to join our team and serve developers through technical demos. We're on a mission to challenge and empower developers to build the future of communications with Twilio APIs.

Who?

You are a developer. You love building applications, and equally importantly, sharing them with others. Beyond just showing what you've built, you're motivated to share how you built it so other developers are inspired to create their own experiences using your ideas.

You are a storyteller. You know that the best demos take someone on a journey that has a beginning, middle and end. You enjoy telling these stories on stage and online.

You are a collaborator. You're not hesitant to gather input from the people around you to help create the best experiences for your audience. You bring diverse voices to the conversation to ensure you build applications that aren't only reflective of yourself, but of our entire community.

As a Developer Educator for demos you will be driving, designing, and building both real world and visionary use cases using Twilio's powerful APIs and software platforms.

Specifically, we're looking for a developer with:


2+ years of experience in a software engineering or similar role
Backend development experience in either Node.js, C#, Python, or PHP
Frontend development experience with React
Experience building with REST APIs at scale
Comfortable giving live technical demos in front of an audience

What?

As a Developer Educator, you will live the Twilio Magic values:

BE AN OWNER & BE BOLD: You'll create the live demos Twilio uses at developer events. You'll work with stakeholders to create the narrative, write the code, and train developers throughout Twilio to take your demos to our community.

EMPOWER OTHERS: You'll also empower developers online by building interactive demos for our website, reaching an even larger audience as they start building on Twilio.

Specifically, in this role you will:


Build and iterate the demos we show at our Engage roadshow events
Craft the narrative and ship the demos that will be shown on the main stage at SIGNAL, our annual conference
Work closely with our partners across the company in Sales, Marketing, and Product
Iterate on our strategy for online interactive demos by shipping experiments and analyzing their results

Why?

Twilio is truly unique; we are a company committed to your growth, your learning, your development, and your entire employee experience. We only win when our employees succeed and we're dedicated to helping you develop your strengths. We invest in weeks dedicated to tackling hard problems and creating your own ideas. We have a cultural foundation built on diversity, inclusion, and innovation and we want you and your ideas to thrive at Twilio. Come join us.

Where?

Our team is fully distributed, so you will interact remotely with the Developer Education team. You will enjoy all of Twilio's incredible perks: monthly Kindle book reimbursement, monthly gym reimbursement, bi-weekly All Hands and more. Between our Superclass training events and team meetings, you will be expected to travel 1-2 times per quarter. We also believe that in order to do this job well, you need a balanced work and home life. We offer generous PTO. What you will also get to experience is a company that believes in small teams for maximum impact; that strives to balance work and home life, that understands that this is a marathon, not a sprint; that continuously and purposefully builds an inclusive culture where everyone is able to do and be the best version of themselves. We seek people who naturally demonstrate our values, who are challenged by problems, empower others to thrive, people who can draw the owl and not be beholden to one playbook.

About us:

Millions of developers around the world have used Twilio to unlock the magic of communications to improve any human experience. Twilio has democratized communications channels like voice, text, chat, video and email by virtualizing the world's communications infrastructure through APIs that are simple enough for any developer to use, yet robust enough to power the world's most demanding applications.

The Who, What, Why and Where

Twilio has over 20 products that enable developers to build communications solutions into their custom workflows and apps. But communications are complicated, asynchronous systems and things can go wrong in very unexpected ways that a simple try/catch block can't always detect. And add on a contact center product like Flex--which is built on top of our platform primitives like Voice, SMS, and TaskRouter--and you have a dependency map that makes it incredibly hard to debug when something goes wrong.

With all of these products in an ""always be deploying"" mindset, our customers need to know when we're going to change things that might affect them. The Transparency team at Twilio exists to provide customers a best-in-class developer experience when debugging distributed systems and flawless communications about our ever-evolving product lineup.

Who?

Twilio is looking for a leader who lives the Twilio Magic and has a demonstrated track record of technical decision making and distributed systems architecture. They also have:


A passion for Developer Experience. They provide feedback when they find incorrect docs and aren't afraid to open issues and PRs against public SDKs.
Deep knowledge of 2+ object-oriented, compiled programming languages and 2+ interpreted languages.
7+ years experience owning, operating, deploying, and monitoring cloud-based RESTful microservices at scale; and have worked with technologies like Chef, Docker, or Terraform.
3+ years mentoring junior engineers with code reviews, software engineering best practices, and collaborative design.
A roll-up-the-sleeves mentality for digging into multiple codebases to get to the root of a problem.
Front-end experience with React, Redux, Typescript, or related technologies.
A preference for collaboration -- they find success in learning from others and helping them be successful.
Opinions and a high bar for software quality and availability, and connect the dots between those metrics and your customers' success.
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or similar experience

What?

As a Technical Lead, you will live the Twilio Magic values:


WRITE IT DOWN: You will write Engineering Design documents in collaboration with Product, and collaborate on product spec and user stories documents. You will also write thorough and well-scoped tickets with clear definitions of done for the rest of the engineering team.
DRAW THE OWL AND WEAR THE CUSTOMER'S SHOES: There is no instruction book for a lot of what the Transparency team is trying to solve. There might be some industry best practices, but we frequently have to wear our customer's shoes to propose solutions that meet their needs.
BE AN OWNER: As the Technical Lead, you are not only responsible for the architecture of the system, you are oncall for it. You care deeply about your services' performance and quality, and measure those characteristics rigorously with data.
EMPOWER OTHERS AND BE INCLUSIVE: The technical lead is the primary mentor for the team. You will spend much of your time setting standards, reviewing PRs, challenging the team to think big picture about what we build, and making sure all voices are heard.
RUTHLESSLY PRIORITIZE: You will have opinions about the tallest nails of technical risk our team carries, and can prioritize that risk against feature development and work to keep other services running.

Why?

Transparency is a unique type of team: we are both a platform team that ingests data from other product teams and a product team ourselves that builds tools to present that data to customers. And we do all of this at a massive scale. Internally, we empower and educate product teams with opinions on what good Developer Experience is. Externally, we push the envelope of how customers find out about issues and changes to their Twilio account. Joining this team will challenge you to think outside the box about technologies like data streaming and event-driven programming.

Twilio is a company that is empowering the world's developers with modern communication in order to build better applications. Twilio is truly unique; we are a company committed to your growth, your learning, your development, and your entire employee experience. We only win when our employees succeed and we're dedicated to helping you develop your strengths. We invest in weeks dedicated to tackling hard problems and creating your own ideas. We have a cultural foundation built on diversity, inclusion, and innovation and we want you and your ideas to thrive at Twilio.

Where?

This position will be located in our beautiful office at 1801 California St. in Denver, CO. You will enjoy our incredible perks: catered meals, snacks, game room, ergonomic desks, access to our building fitness center, monthly All Hands and more.

You will also be part of a company that believes in small teams for maximum impact; that strives to balance work and home life; that understands that this is a marathon, not a sprint; that continuously and purposefully builds an inclusive culture where everyone is able to do and be the best version of themselves. We seek people who naturally demonstrate our values, who are challenged by problems, empower others to thrive, and can draw the owl and not be beholden to one playbook.

Our engineering teams are responsible for monetizing the services and infrastructure that connect hundreds of millions of active Twitter users to real-time information about whats relevant in their lives and the world we live in. We work on some of the worlds largest distributed systems -- our core infrastructure receives hundreds of millions of tweets per day and serves tens of billions of API requests, all with an uptime in excess of 99.9%. Our other systems operate at a similarly staggering scale: we serve over 2+ billion search queries per day, render hundreds of millions of ad impressions, process hundreds of terabytes of log and interaction data daily to drive billions in bottom-line revenue.

The Goldbird ads engineering team is responsible for Twitters advertising platform which helps global advertising partners reach their audiences via standard and measurable engagement metrics to grow their businesses. The engineering team builds the highest performance, scalable and reliable data infrastructure in the world to process the billions of events and petabytes of data generated to provide real-time insights into our advertising products. These products, including but not limited to Ads and Analytics help our global advertising partners understand and then join global conversations about their brand via tweets, images and video (on-demand and live). Top brands have many reasons to know what is happening now and use a variety of strategies at Twitter to effectively engage their target audiences.

Goldbird engineering takes the complexity out of reaching a global audience at scale by providing push button self service functionality as well as fully managed solutions. To do this our, team must continually innovate extremely scalable distributed architectures, robust messaging layers (Thrift, Kafka) and cutting edge design and user research techniques. We also contribute to and utilize significant open source technology (Hadoop, Summingbird, Heron, Kafka, MySQL, Aurora, and others).

What You'll Do:

Infrastructure -- Work with our infrastructure teams to contribute to solutions, crack tough problems and mentor engineers on a highly scalable ML integrated ad serving system. Apply your expertise in distributed systems, data centers, databases and large scale systems to simplify the immense complexity of wrangling with humongous amounts of underlying data, enabling Twitter to deliver more value to our partners.

Products -- Work with our full stack team that builds solutions on Twitters APIs and internal platforms. Help guide and align efforts, author necessary code and mentor talented engineers that are focused on delighting advertisers with new insights, measurement and tools to help their businesses thrive.

Learning -- Be a key contributor to Twitters continued use of cutting edge machine learning in all aspects of our solutions. Help guide and mentor this rapidly changing space that helps our users get the right message from their favorite brands and just the right time.

Other mobile publishers -- Help other publishers monetize using Twitters scale and technology via our Mobup offering. Align and drive technology solutions that balance the complex needs of many publishers - measurement, reporting, delivery, etc. with the scale that a single SDK integration offers.

Who You Are:

You're someone with a lot of experience and a number of successes in your past, but now are looking to grow with and help impact a global at scale business. You want to engage in significant projects while working in small teams of highly-talented, passionate engineers to show the team how to model code ownership, collaboration and most importantly - team health. The prospect of getting to work with an open-source tech stack that powers a solution people around the world love to use, and where massive volumes of data are extracted in real time excites you. You want to mentor amazing engineers; but you are also learning and want to see continued investment in you by the business; and you expect excellence in everything. You see your future self as a force multiplier (and not just a great technical resource for an employer). You see challenge as opportunity and you're looking to jump ahead of the pack in your career. You're applying to this role because you're hoping for a chance to jump in and see what you can do to make a difference in an iconic software company.

Requirements:

Experience with native publisher monetization

Experience with ad tech ecosystem (programmatic buying)

Experience with digital video (on-demand and live)

Experience with digital advertising measurement (conversion tracking, etc.)

Backend development experience with a strong interest in work involving data pipelines, distributed systems, performance analysis, and/or large-scale data processing (ideally, in Java)

Experience with software engineering practices (e.g. unit testing, code reviews, design documentation)

Strong algorithms and data structures background

BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science or equivalent work experience

Experience designing fault-tolerant distributed systems

Experience with Hadoop or other MapReduce-based architectures

Experience with Streaming Compute based technologies

Experience with Cassandra, Redis, Memcached or MySQL

Contributions to the open-source community

We build and maintain the large-scale, low latency distributed systems that power Twitter's real-time feature computation, rule engine, and data exploration tools that keep spam, abuse, and adversarial accounts off of Twitter.

If you want to work on a team that does some of the most interesting technical work at Twitter, protects people from real harm, and has executive-level visibility, then this is the team for you.

Who We Are

We're a team of systems engineers that builds and maintains the core infrastructure helping to protect the health of the public conversation. We're motivated by interesting technical challenges -- our real-time feature computation and rules engine runs thousands of rules on half a million events per second -- as well as internal and external customer impact. We work closely with our customers in Trust and Safety, User Services and Data Science to provide a platform for technical and nontechnical customers to deploy new features and rules at scale in seconds.

Our work sits at the intersection of a number of interesting disciplines. We do large-scale real-time event processing that needs to catch some of the smartest adversaries. Our flexible platform serves numerous important internal customers. And we build and maintain a grammar, compiler, and tooling for a Turing-complete rules and feature computation language.

We deploy continuously, write unit tests, and do code review.

What You'll Do

Here are some of the daily duties of the role:



Extend the functionality of the platform, including new language features and new integrations with other systems, to serve our customers' needs.
Profile and stress test to surface inefficiencies in our system.
Tune cache and storage to optimize our runtime performance.
Diagnose issues and debug across the entire stack.
Work with platform services we depend on, including storage, messaging and data platform teams.
Give conference talks, write blog posts, and otherwise evangelize Twitter health engineering internally and externally.
Lead small, hungry project teams to impactful infrastructure wins.
Communicate with stakeholders and build consensus around the technical roadmap.


Who You Are



You've built and maintained a large-scale distributed system before and have the scars to prove it.
You value deleted code -- and code never written -- just as much as the code that you do write.
You're willing to be coached and to coach others.
You know when it's okay to take on technical debt and you eventually pay it down.
You can balance quality work vs customer requests vs new features.
You can make the right product and technical decisions independently.

Here's all the legal good stuff:

We are committed to an inclusive and diverse Twitter. Twitter is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate based on race, ethnicity, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability, veteran, genetic information, marital status or any other legally protected status.

Software Engineer - Ad Serving (Revenue Platform)Boston, MA

Who we are:

The Ads Serving team builds the most critical systems and infrastructure in our whole business thats directly responsible for our multi-billion dollar revenue stream. More can be found here: https://blog.twitter.com/2016/resilient-ad-serving-at-twitter-scale

Context, responsibilities, and challenges:

Twitter is synonymous with staggering scale. Hundreds of millions of users use our service every single day, generating huge amounts of traffic, often in an unpredictable manner. Advertisers seize these opportunities and react quickly to reach their target audience in real time, resulting in demand surges in the marketplace. In the midst of such variability, Twitters ad server  our revenue engine  performs ad matching, scoring, and ad serving at an immense scale.

We face a set of daunting challenges: Process tens of billions of ad requests, serve billions of ads both on- and off-Twitter with tight latency constraints, be highly available (four-nines+), be resilient to massive query spikes, reliably deliver the highest quality ads possible for every query, and do all of this at minimal cost (optimal resource utilization). Our ad serving engine is built to take on these challenges.

In addition, we also build systems that process ad spend information in real-time. The live-spend pipeline, which works hand-in-hand with serving, is also a massively scalable system that processes impressions, clicks and engagements using real time stream processing technologies, and provides data to the serving, billing, and advertiser-analytics systems.

In order to achieve all this, we use state of the art open-source and proprietary technologies, and build some of the worlds largest and most complex distributed systems. If you are passionate about building such world-class systems, we invite you to join our team!

What youll do:

Be a technical lead or an individual contributor and partner with a high performing team in head quarters (SF).Build the worlds best ad server: The ad server is composed internally of several core tier-1 services (services with strict SLAs around high availability). You will play a direct role in architecting, designing, developing and operationalizing these high performance, scalable, reliable and resilient services. In doing so, you will interact with several subsystems and sister teams such as our Prediction, Targeting, Data Infrastructure, User Modeling, Marketplace, Billing, and Ad Formats teams. Ads is serious business, and ad serving is a highly complex space. This role will stretch your capabilities, and challenge you to come up with the best, most effective engineering architecture to address the complex demands of the business.Build a world-class live-spend pipeline: You will be exposed to the best in streaming compute technologies as you help build and evolve our live-spend pipeline. The ads we serve result in a massive stream of user-driven engagements (impressions, clicks) flowing back at us, and the responsibility of processing these engagements, applying the right traffic-quality and click-fraud filters, and ensuring the accuracy of the raw data used for serving, billing, and analytics lies with the live-spend pipeline.Help craft Twitters revenue roadmap and shepherd critical projects: Since we are the delivery engine for all our ads, we play a central role in the Revenue organization. In this role, you will work very closely with the rest of Revenue in crafting and prioritizing our roadmap, and shepherding projects that are critical to our companys revenue strategy.

What else can you expect:

We believe that people are our strongest asset, and take special interest in each and every one of our engineers. You can expect a real investment in your professional growth, and a commitment to crafting a strong, sustainable career for you. Our teams are composed of highly talented and passionate 'A' players, and youll get the mentorship and coaching you deserve to hone your skills and expertise. Our vibrant culture and work environment will kindle your passion and bring out the best in you!

You will also be joining the Twitter Boston engineering community! You will be surrounded by 6+ engineering teams that play key roles in almost every aspect of Twitters business. While the office continues to grow, Twitter Boston has maintained a small startup feel and the engineers here share a common focus of delighting users.

Who You Are:

You're someone with a lot of potential who is constantly looking for real engineering challenges to tackle and hard problems to solve. You want to own significant projects while working in small teams of highly-talented, passionate engineers. The prospect of getting to work with an open-source tech stack that powers a solution people around the world love to use, and where massive volumes of data are extracted in real time excites you. You want to be mentored by amazing engineers; you want to see continued investment in you by the business; and you expect excellence in everything. You see your future self as a force multiplier (and not just a great technical resource for an employer). You see challenge as opportunity and you're looking to jump ahead of the pack in your career. You're applying to this role because you're hoping for a chance to jump in and see what you can do to make a difference in an iconic software company.

Requirements:

Strong CS fundamentals: algorithms, data structures, design patterns, etc.4+ years of backend or distributed systems experience Backend development experience with a solid foundation in fault-tolerant and resilient distributed systems, concepts of asynchronous programming, concurrency, performance analysis, and/or large-scale data processingDirect experience building systems with online components to them (i.e., they serve requests to users)A solid grasp on good software engineering practices (e.g. thorough code reviews, deep focus on quality, design documentation)Great communication skillsBS, MS, or PhD in computer science or a related field, or equivalent work experience
