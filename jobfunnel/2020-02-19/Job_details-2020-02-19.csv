The Who, What, Where and Why

You're a developer that enjoys empowering your peers. Some of your favorite projects during your career have likely been things like building MVPs, demo applications, or proofs of concepts. You get excited about starting the next project, incorporating what you've learned from the last ship.

We're looking for a Developer Educator to join our team and serve developers through technical demos. We're on a mission to challenge and empower developers to build the future of communications with Twilio APIs.

Who?

You are a developer. You love building applications, and equally importantly, sharing them with others. Beyond just showing what you've built, you're motivated to share how you built it so other developers are inspired to create their own experiences using your ideas.

You are a storyteller. You know that the best demos take someone on a journey that has a beginning, middle and end. You enjoy telling these stories on stage and online.

You are a collaborator. You're not hesitant to gather input from the people around you to help create the best experiences for your audience. You bring diverse voices to the conversation to ensure you build applications that aren't only reflective of yourself, but of our entire community.

As a Developer Educator for demos you will be driving, designing, and building both real world and visionary use cases using Twilio's powerful APIs and software platforms.

Specifically, we're looking for a developer with:


2+ years of experience in a software engineering or similar role
Backend development experience in either Node.js, C#, Python, or PHP
Frontend development experience with React
Experience building with REST APIs at scale
Comfortable giving live technical demos in front of an audience

What?

As a Developer Educator, you will live the Twilio Magic values:

BE AN OWNER & BE BOLD: You'll create the live demos Twilio uses at developer events. You'll work with stakeholders to create the narrative, write the code, and train developers throughout Twilio to take your demos to our community.

EMPOWER OTHERS: You'll also empower developers online by building interactive demos for our website, reaching an even larger audience as they start building on Twilio.

Specifically, in this role you will:


Build and iterate the demos we show at our Engage roadshow events
Craft the narrative and ship the demos that will be shown on the main stage at SIGNAL, our annual conference
Work closely with our partners across the company in Sales, Marketing, and Product
Iterate on our strategy for online interactive demos by shipping experiments and analyzing their results

Why?

Twilio is truly unique; we are a company committed to your growth, your learning, your development, and your entire employee experience. We only win when our employees succeed and we're dedicated to helping you develop your strengths. We invest in weeks dedicated to tackling hard problems and creating your own ideas. We have a cultural foundation built on diversity, inclusion, and innovation and we want you and your ideas to thrive at Twilio. Come join us.

Where?

Our team is fully distributed, so you will interact remotely with the Developer Education team. You will enjoy all of Twilio's incredible perks: monthly Kindle book reimbursement, monthly gym reimbursement, bi-weekly All Hands and more. Between our Superclass training events and team meetings, you will be expected to travel 1-2 times per quarter. We also believe that in order to do this job well, you need a balanced work and home life. We offer generous PTO. What you will also get to experience is a company that believes in small teams for maximum impact; that strives to balance work and home life, that understands that this is a marathon, not a sprint; that continuously and purposefully builds an inclusive culture where everyone is able to do and be the best version of themselves. We seek people who naturally demonstrate our values, who are challenged by problems, empower others to thrive, people who can draw the owl and not be beholden to one playbook.

The Who, What, Why and Where

Twilio has over 20 products that enable developers to build communications solutions into their custom workflows and apps. But communications are complicated, asynchronous systems and things can go wrong in very unexpected ways that a simple try/catch block can't always detect. And add on a contact center product like Flex--which is built on top of our platform primitives like Voice, SMS, and TaskRouter--and you have a dependency map that makes it incredibly hard to debug when something goes wrong.

With all of these products in an ""always be deploying"" mindset, our customers need to know when we're going to change things that might affect them. The Transparency team at Twilio exists to provide customers a best-in-class developer experience when debugging distributed systems and flawless communications about our ever-evolving product lineup.

Who?

Twilio is looking for a leader who lives the Twilio Magic and has a demonstrated track record of technical decision making and distributed systems architecture. They also have:


A passion for Developer Experience. They provide feedback when they find incorrect docs and aren't afraid to open issues and PRs against public SDKs.
Deep knowledge of 2+ object-oriented, compiled programming languages and 2+ interpreted languages.
7+ years experience owning, operating, deploying, and monitoring cloud-based RESTful microservices at scale; and have worked with technologies like Chef, Docker, or Terraform.
3+ years mentoring junior engineers with code reviews, software engineering best practices, and collaborative design.
A roll-up-the-sleeves mentality for digging into multiple codebases to get to the root of a problem.
Front-end experience with React, Redux, Typescript, or related technologies.
A preference for collaboration -- they find success in learning from others and helping them be successful.
Opinions and a high bar for software quality and availability, and connect the dots between those metrics and your customers' success.
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or similar experience

What?

As a Technical Lead, you will live the Twilio Magic values:


WRITE IT DOWN: You will write Engineering Design documents in collaboration with Product, and collaborate on product spec and user stories documents. You will also write thorough and well-scoped tickets with clear definitions of done for the rest of the engineering team.
DRAW THE OWL AND WEAR THE CUSTOMER'S SHOES: There is no instruction book for a lot of what the Transparency team is trying to solve. There might be some industry best practices, but we frequently have to wear our customer's shoes to propose solutions that meet their needs.
BE AN OWNER: As the Technical Lead, you are not only responsible for the architecture of the system, you are oncall for it. You care deeply about your services' performance and quality, and measure those characteristics rigorously with data.
EMPOWER OTHERS AND BE INCLUSIVE: The technical lead is the primary mentor for the team. You will spend much of your time setting standards, reviewing PRs, challenging the team to think big picture about what we build, and making sure all voices are heard.
RUTHLESSLY PRIORITIZE: You will have opinions about the tallest nails of technical risk our team carries, and can prioritize that risk against feature development and work to keep other services running.

Why?

Transparency is a unique type of team: we are both a platform team that ingests data from other product teams and a product team ourselves that builds tools to present that data to customers. And we do all of this at a massive scale. Internally, we empower and educate product teams with opinions on what good Developer Experience is. Externally, we push the envelope of how customers find out about issues and changes to their Twilio account. Joining this team will challenge you to think outside the box about technologies like data streaming and event-driven programming.

The goal is to develop a distributed processing system that rapidly coordinates multi-messenger follow-up observations triggered by IceCube with existing observations and real-time surveys; to develop data analysis tools helping to correlate IceCube neutrino observations with other astronomical data such as gravitational wave, gamma-ray, and optical observations; and to develop interactive visualization and analysis tools to support these multi-messenger astronomical observations.

The IceCube detector consists of more than 5000 optical sensors deployed over one kilometer-deep in the Antarctic ice. A collaboration of scientists from over forty world-wide research institutions collectively participate in a research program to study high-energy neutrinos from cosmic sources. MSU is home to one of the largest and most active IceCube groups in the United States. The NSF-funded SCiMMA Institute (https://scimma.org) is beginning to prototype community-wide alert processing and follow-up platform for multi-messenger astronomy. This system will enable cross-correlating numerous alert streams, leading to the next great leap in discovery and follow-up of the most energetic phenomena in the universe (from supernovae to merging black holes).

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
