Being an Associate Quality Designer is more than being a tester  its about supporting your team and growing with your colleagues. As part of an experienced cross-functional engineering team you will collaborate with your dev team partners to identify and drive workflow, process, and automation improvement opportunities, and get to formulate creative or technical solutions to the problems in front of and ahead of you.

You will take lessons learned and apply them to your next iteration.
