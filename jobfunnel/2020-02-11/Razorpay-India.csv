new,Senior Android Engineer,Razorpay,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",2020-01-13,"Hi there! It's good to have you here. A round of intros first, what say?


Who and what of Razorpay
Razorpay is gathering of folks from various walks of life. We have suave designers, magical engineers, sales hustlers, calm-as-rock customer champions and then some. Together we are trying to bring modern technology into the backbone of the internet and that's online payments. We believe that someone is doing his/her job all wrong if the customers have to tear their hair over accepting payments online.


We have gone from nothing to a full fledged, modern and robust online payments system. Our customers swear by our tech and UX, and we are ecstatic to see people enjoy the results of our fanatic focus on making online payments simple and accessible. We provide the smoothest payment experience that money can buy right now in India. With a marquee list of investors, cash in bank and a low burn rate, we are here for years to stay, to lead and demonstrate how online payments should be.


And you are?
Someone who thinks technology is the answer to life, universe and everything. You don't want to hide behind the mundanity of a corporate job, a cog in the bigger scheme that's unknown. You want to own what you do and drive it to completion, with a touch of perfection befitting your zeal for your work. You swear by version control and you bow to the church of test driven development. You love your tech and automation is your religion.


Now that you know us and we know you, let's talk about the culture you can expect at Razorpay.


All things culture
We treat all our employees as adults, even if they are legally not one. We think that you can do your best with a freedom to experiment, sense of ownership of your work, licence to fail and when you have peers who care just as much as you about their art. We default to transparency because everyone can contribute to anything, and it's only possible if you get to know what's going on. We prefer to mingle with the community through meetups and conferences on topics as broad as daylight. And at the end of the day we accept that we are humans, fallible to error, learning through errors together. After all, there's comedy in error too.


We believe in having the best tools for the job. We are happy paying customers of GitHub, Clearbit, Zendesk and Slack, some of the most important tools in our workflow. Our people select the laptops on which they think they can do their best. We also provide free e-books for constant learning, free VMs for side-projects and an in-office gym to keep you at your best, always.

Convert our entire merchant dashboard into a powerful mobile application, for the modern age merchants who are always on the go

Contribute to open source as we set the standards for mobile payments
And, most importantly, brainstorm and create new directions that Razorpay can take in our quest to make online payments easy and accessible to all
