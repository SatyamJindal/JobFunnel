- Language platform specific solutions like Mobile & Backed Developer experience and Frameworks

- Platforms like Internationalization, Developer Analytics etc.

Below are the teams that we are currently hiring Backend developers for:

Healthline: Our platform enables Uber to quickly and reliably detect, report, and troubleshoot issues in our mobile apps. It captures various types of mobile app signals such as app crashes, exceptions, app not responding, memory leaks etc., classifies and reports(ticketing and alerting) issues in our mobile apps. Healthline also offers a web portal to show the list of issues and related data, logs, and stats, which allow developers to quickly troubleshoot the root cause of the reported issues.

Wisdom: Our mission is to simplify the mobile in-app bug reporting experience to capture more high quality bugs, and build a ML-powered bug triaging platform to help engineers to quickly triage and troubleshoot the reported bugs. Wisdom platform has three major components.

- A mobile SDK, which can be used by different mobile apps to onboard the in-app bug reporting flow easily to wisdom.

- Backend processing pipeline and ML models, which processes inbound bugs to filter out noise and surface critical bugs to engineers.

- Wisdom triage portal, the web portal that engineers use to triage and troubleshoot the reported bugs.

Core Automation Platform (CAP): We provide a reliable and automated end-to-end testing framework for mobile sanity tests. Our tools allow safeguarding features and preventing regressions for each release and CD build, enabling mobile developers to build reliable Apps quickly.","java , python , Mysql , database , list , performance , testing , web , memory , mobile , Mobile , filter , types , deployment , build",https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=117&ao=101641&s=58&guid=00000170394a4bd2a3a059595a70d7bf&src=GD_JOB_AD&t=SR&extid=1&exst=OL&ist=&ast=OL&vt=w&slr=true&cs=1_47100e91&cb=1581509135481&jobListingId=3487002833,3487002833,glassdoor,Uber developer
