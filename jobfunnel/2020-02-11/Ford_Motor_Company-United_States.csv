new,Manufacturing Software Developer,Ford Motor Company,"Sunrise, FL",2020-01-13,"The role is for a software developer working on device side code to support three areas of responsibility of hardware testing. The first area is the functional testing of hardware in the devices at the factory where they are built. The second aspect is the design verification of the hardware via at bench testing by hardware team members or via automated reliability testing performed by the hardware team in lab environments. And the third aspect is supporting the hardware team as they work with the software running on the device either for factory, reliability and the final product software that runs on the device in the vehicle.

For the factory, the team delivers software that interacts with hardware drivers to execute test commands and send responses back to a PC station. The team works in close collaboration with hardware teams, various device software teams for drivers and the factory-manufacturing specialists who are designing the tests. This software will interact with all of the various hardware that is part of the device. This can be simple GPIOs and extends to working with audio, accelerometers, interprocessor communications, CAN bus communications, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular radios, I2C, GPS, USB, etc.

For the bench and reliability testing, the team needs to support additional requirements for the specifics of those tests that extend what is supplied to the factory. The team members will also need to work in cooperation with the hardware team members to root cause issues seen to determine if these are hardware or software issues exposed during the extreme conditions and/or multiple repetitions of the tests.

The device software depending on the processor, operating system and requirements is written using C++ object oriented code, C and LUA scripting. The software developer requires knowledge of GitHub, Linux OS, QNX OS, hardware and software debugging tools, and embedded software architectures. The software developer will use these tools and environments to create and deliver high quality factory and reliability software.

The Factory team works very closely with the hardware team who are collocated with the Factory Team members in Sunrise, FL. The Factory team works with the hardware team to provide device configuration and software loading support on behalf of domains teams. The Factory team debugs software/hardware interface issues side-by-side with the hardware team. The software developer needs to understand hardware block diagrams, schematics, hardware IC specifications, software programming specifications, and real time software drivers operation for effective debugging and development.

The Factory team works in a distributed environment. Various teams and third party vendors are geographically spread in different locations and time zones. The Factory team works with numerous Domain Teams that have unique expertise and knowledge. The software developer needs to assimilate knowledge from these domains teams in order to effectively support the hardware team. This position will also require travel to factory builds in remote locations to support factory processes and solve issues in real time.
