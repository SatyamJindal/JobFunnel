We are responsible for the core architecture and data of the Salesforce instance and our project teams are cross-functional and collaborative. We follow Agile and iterative processes.

Your job:

As a Salesforce Developer at Indeed, you will be responsible for developing business features and technical capabilities within Indeed's Salesforce instance and related data, services, and applications.

You will drive the implementation and delivery of development projects and work directly with technical leaders as well as Product Managers, Program Managers, and business stakeholders to ensure the success of your projects.

You'll be expected to grow your technical skills and knowledge of the Salesforce platform, learning new Salesforce products and technologies as the team is implementing them. For some projects, you'll also work full-stack on Indeed's internal Java and Python development platform. Your projects will require the creation of new components, data models, and APIs, as well as the addition of new functionality to existing components, data models, and APIs.
